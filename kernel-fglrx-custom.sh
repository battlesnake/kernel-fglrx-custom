# Kernel build script to enable use of old Radeons on newer (but not
# quite _really new_) kernels.

# The kernel version number
VERSION=3.4.59
# The kernel flavour (e.g. lts, arch, lowlatency, etc)
FLAVOUR=fglrx-custom

# For now, run as root.  I trust the kernel developers to produce safe,
# virus-free, bug-free makefiles.  They are a clever bunch of people
# after all.  Since building as root is a cardinal sin to some, someone
# else can modify this to do the appropriate chrooting and sudo stuff,
# if they so desire.
#
# Untested features:
#  + Kernel version != 3.4.59
#  + Filenames/paths containing spaces
#  + Auto-downloading kernel
#  + Auto-moving script to download folder
#
# The kernel source should be extracted to:
#   /usr/src/linux-$VERSION-$FLAVOUR
# Alternatively, be a nice guinea pig and test the automatic download by
# running this script from any folder you can write to, after setting the
# VERSION variable to the kernel that you want to auto-download.
#
# If you aren't a guinea pig, copy this script to the kernel source folder,
# make it your working directory then execute this script.  Alternatively,
# modify the SRCDIR variable.
#
# The VERSION and FLAVOUR can actually be anything you want, as long as
# the above path is valid and points to the kernel source.  Otherwise, the
# VERSION must be a valid kernel.org version number, for the untested automatic
# download to be able to find a source.
#
# The output of the build is located in:
#  $SRCDIR/$OUTDIR if SRCDIR has been modified.
# which by default would be:
#   /usr/src/linux-$VERSION-$FLAVOUR/$OUTDIR
# if you extracted a kernel source to that folder, set it as the working
# directory and ran the script from it.
#
# Note regarding the purpose of the commented "boot" lines at the end:
#   I have three operating systems (Arch / Ubuntu / Windows 2003) across two
# SSDs so I stuck a grub boot partition on each SSD to provide me with:
#  a) a backup bootloader should an Ubuntu update (predictably) screw one up
#  b) the ability to pull a disk and boot it straight away in another PC easily
# The boot partitions are mounted in /boot and /boot2, so this script will
# put a vmlinuz*, initrd*.img, and grub/grub.cfg on on BOTH boot partitions.
# Other people may want to remove the lines containing "/boot2/" near the end
# of this script for clarity.
#
# The script MAY be able to download the kernel source and prepare it, but this
# has NOT been tested at all.
